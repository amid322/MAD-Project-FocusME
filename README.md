# FocusME 
**Stay disciplined, Stay productive**

## Project Description
FocusME is an Android application designed to help  students combat digital distractions and enhance their study productivity. In today's connected world, students constantly struggle with smartphone interruptions from apps like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, which fragment their focus and reduce learning efficiency.

Our app provides a structured solution by allowing students to set dedicated focus timers for their study sessions. During these sessions, FocusON employs motivational alerts and reminders to discourage the use of distracting applications, helping users build better digital habits, increase productivity, and reduce study-related stress.
